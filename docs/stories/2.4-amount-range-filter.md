# Story 2.4: Amount Range Filter - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** banking dashboard user,
**I want** to filter transactions by amount range with minimum and maximum values,
**So that** I can focus on transactions within specific amount ranges for better analysis.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: FilterBar component (`/src/components/dashboard/FilterBar.tsx`)
- Technology: React/TypeScript, Zustand store, shadcn/ui components
- Follows pattern: Existing filter components in `/src/components/filters/` (SearchFilter, DateRangePicker, StatusFilter)
- Touch points: Dashboard store (`useDashboardStore`), `TransactionDatabase.getTransactions()`

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Amount range filter provides minimum and maximum amount input fields
2. Filter integrates with existing filter system and works alongside search, date, and status filters
3. Filter respects Colombian peso formatting conventions (amounts in COP)

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing FilterBar layout accommodates new amount range filter without breaking responsive design
5. New functionality follows existing filter component pattern (debounced input, local state management)
6. Integration with dashboard store maintains current `setFilters` behavior and transaction fetching

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Amount validation ensures min ≤ max with user feedback for invalid ranges
8. Filter state persists and clears properly with existing "Limpiar" button functionality
9. No regression in existing search, date range, and status filtering functionality

  - [x] Extend TransactionDatabase.getTransactions() to handle amount range
  - [x] Add numeric range WHERE clauses for min/max amounts
  - [x] Test query performance with amount filtering
- [x] Testing and validation (AC: 7, 9)
  - [x] Add unit tests for AmountRangeFilter component
  - [x] Test integration with existing filters
  - [x] Perform regression testing on existing functionality
  - [x] Verify Colombian peso formatting and validation

## Dev Notes

**Relevant Source Tree Information:**
- Filter components location: `/src/components/filters/`
- Store location: `/src/stores/dashboard.ts`
- Database operations: `/src/lib/database.ts` 
- FilterBar component: `/src/components/dashboard/FilterBar.tsx`
- UI components: shadcn/ui Input component used in existing filters

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Transaction amount field is stored as `number` type (Transaction interface in `/src/lib/types.ts`)
- Database queries use `TransactionDatabase.getTransactions()` with filter parameters
- Existing pattern: debounced input with 300ms delay (see SearchFilter implementation)
- Store integration: `setFilters()` method triggers `fetchTransactions()` with new filters
- Colombian peso context: amounts represent COP currency values

**Integration Pattern to Follow:**
- Follow SearchFilter component pattern exactly (`/src/components/filters/search-filter.tsx`)
- Use `useDashboardStore()` hook for state management
- Implement local state with debounced updates to store
- Use shadcn/ui Input components for consistency
- Handle state synchronization with store updates

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: Component tests in same directory as component with `.test.tsx` extension
- Test framework: Jest + React Testing Library (as established in project)
- Test patterns: Component rendering, user interaction, store integration
- Specific requirements: Test amount validation, debounced input behavior, filter integration

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Create new `AmountRangeFilter` component following existing filter pattern, add to FilterBar grid layout, extend store FilterState interface
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow SearchFilter pattern (`/src/components/filters/search-filter.tsx`) - debounced state, store integration, shadcn/ui Input components
- **Key Constraints:** Amount stored as `number` type in Transaction interface, database queries use numeric comparison, maintain Colombian peso context

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met
- [x] Integration requirements verified
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [x] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)

## Risk and Compatibility Assessment

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Database query performance with additional numeric range filtering
- **Mitigation:** Use indexed amount column, implement efficient range query in TransactionDatabase
- **Rollback:** Remove AmountRangeFilter component and revert FilterBar layout changes

**Compatibility Verification:**
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing APIs - extends FilterState interface with optional fields
- ✅ Database changes are query-only (no schema changes needed)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing FilterBar grid pattern and responsive design
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (single additional WHERE clause on indexed column)
