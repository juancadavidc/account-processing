# Story 2.3: Frontend-Backend Integration for Real-time Dashboard

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** business owner monitoring incoming payments,  
**I want** the dashboard to display real transaction data from the database and receive live updates when new transactions arrive via webhook,  
**so that** I can see accurate, up-to-date business deposit information instead of mock data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Replace mock data with real database queries for all dashboard components
2. Implement Supabase real-time subscriptions for live transaction updates
3. Dashboard automatically updates within 1-2 seconds when new transactions are processed
4. All existing filtering, searching, and sorting functionality works with real data
5. Performance maintains <2 second initial load time with real database queries
6. Error handling for database connection failures and real-time subscription issues
7. Graceful fallback when real-time updates fail (periodic refresh)
8. Metrics calculations (daily/weekly/monthly) work with real transaction data
9. Transaction table pagination works efficiently with database queries
10. Real-time indicator shows connection status and last update time

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Source**: [docs/architecture.md#real-time-architecture-phase-2]

### Real-time Integration Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture.md#supabase-realtime-integration]
The frontend must integrate with Supabase real-time subscriptions:
```typescript
// Client-side real-time subscription
const supabase = createClientComponentClient();

useEffect(() => {
  const channel = supabase
    .channel('transactions')
    .on('postgres_changes', 
      { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'transactions' },
      (payload) => {
        // Update local state with new transaction
        addTransaction(payload.new as Transaction);
        // Trigger metrics recalculation
        refreshMetrics();
      }
    )
    .subscribe();

  return () => supabase.removeChannel(channel);
}, []);
```

### Database Query Patterns
[Source: docs/architecture.md#database-schema]
Replace mock data with these database patterns:
- Use existing Supabase client configuration from `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- Leverage database indexes for efficient querying (date-based queries)
- Implement pagination with limit/offset or cursor-based pagination
- Use database aggregations for metrics instead of client-side calculations

### State Management Updates
[Source: docs/architecture.md#state-management-zustand]  
Update existing Zustand store to handle real data:
```typescript
interface DashboardStore {
  // Keep existing interface but update actions
  transactions: Transaction[];
  metrics: Record<string, DashboardMetrics>;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  realTimeConnected: boolean; // NEW: Track real-time status
  
  // Updated actions for real data
  fetchTransactions: (filters?: FilterOptions) => Promise<void>;
  subscribeToRealTime: () => void;
  unsubscribeFromRealTime: () => void;
}
```

### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture.md#performance-requirements]
- **Dashboard Load**: Maintain <2 seconds initial load with real data
- **Real-time Updates**: 1-2 second acceptable latency for UI updates  
- **Scalability**: Handle 1000+ transactions without performance degradation
- **Pagination**: Limit table results to 50 items per page
- **Caching**: Implement metrics caching with appropriate TTL

### Database Client Configuration
[Source: Previous Story Context from Story 2.1]
Database client already configured and available:
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration
- `src/lib/database.ts` - Database operation utilities
- Real-time subscriptions enabled for transactions table
- Service role credentials configured for database operations

### Existing Frontend Components to Update
Based on project structure analysis:
- `src/stores/dashboard.ts` - Main store needs real data integration
- `src/components/dashboard/MetricsCards.tsx` - Update for real metrics
- `src/components/dashboard/TransactionTable.tsx` - Connect to real data
- `src/components/charts/*.tsx` - All charts need real data integration
- `src/hooks/useMockDataLoader.ts` - Replace with real data loader

### Mock Data Replacement Strategy
[Source: Current Implementation Analysis]
Replace these mock data elements:
- Remove `src/lib/mock-data.ts` dependency from dashboard components
- Update `src/hooks/useMockDataLoader.ts` to become `useDataLoader.ts`
- Replace mock real-time simulation with actual Supabase subscriptions
- Update all dashboard components to handle loading states from database queries

### Real-time Connection Management
[Source: docs/architecture.md#real-time-architecture]
- Implement connection status tracking and display
- Handle reconnection logic for dropped real-time connections
- Add periodic fallback refresh when real-time is unavailable
- Show last update timestamp to users for transparency

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture.md#error-handling]
Required error handling patterns:
- Database connection failures with user-friendly messages
- Real-time subscription failures with automatic retry
- Query timeout handling with loading state management
- Graceful degradation when backend services are unavailable

### File Locations for Updates
Based on project structure:
- **Store Updates**: `src/stores/dashboard.ts` (replace mock actions with real data actions)
- **Data Layer**: `src/lib/database.ts` (add transaction query functions)
- **Real-time**: `src/lib/realtime.ts` (already exists, integrate with dashboard)
- **Components**: Update existing dashboard components in `src/components/dashboard/`
- **Hooks**: Transform `src/hooks/useMockDataLoader.ts` to real data hook

### Environment Variables
[Source: docs/architecture.md#environment-variables]  
Required for database integration:
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ... # For client-side database reads
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development|production
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]
Testing must include:
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end real-time subscription testing
- **Performance Tests**: Dashboard load times with real data
- **Error Handling Tests**: Database failure scenarios
- **Real-time Tests**: Verify updates propagate correctly to UI

#### Test File Locations  
- `src/stores/__tests__/dashboard.test.ts` (update existing tests)
- `src/components/dashboard/__tests__/` (update component tests for real data)
- Add integration tests for real-time functionality

### Previous Story Context
